Only variable that should be of concern in the code is "screens" variable.

What you can change:
1) You can increase the number of rounds and steps to do it is,
- create two images for the round-3 suppose,
- add the correct image in res/imgs/true directory and rename it 3.png
- add the incorrect image in res/imgs/false directory and rename it 3.png as well
- now go to "max_play" and change 2 to 3, increases the number of rounds.

Now, you should have 3 rounds.
